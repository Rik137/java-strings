Regex & String
📌 Overview
This repository contains simple Java examples demonstrating the use of regular expressions and string manipulation.
Each class solves a separate task: cleaning phone numbers, splitting text into words, and numbering words in a sentence.
📂 Structure
1. Regex tasks
PhoneCleanerRegex
Cleans a phone number input from extra characters.
Supports numbers in the format 8XXXXXXXXXX or 7XXXXXXXXXX.
Normalizes them to the format 7XXXXXXXXXX.
Validates the result with regex.
Enter 0 to exit the program.
Example:
Input: +8 (912) 345-67-89
Output: 79123456789
Input: 0
(program terminates)
SplitText
Removes all characters except Latin letters and spaces.
Splits the text into words.
Prints each word on a new line.
Example:
Input: "the really cool day today"
Output:
the
really
cool
day
today
2. String task
SequentialWordsNumbers
Numbers words in a sentence sequentially.
Example:
String input = "Java is fun";
String result = SequentialWordsNumbers.sequentialWordsNumbers(input);
System.out.println(result);
Output:
(1) Java (2) is (3) fun
